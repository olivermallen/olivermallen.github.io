            I worked with Professor <a href="http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/">Emilio Ferrara</a> and <a href="http://echen102.github.io/">Emily Chen</a> to study how the style and composition of protest imagery posted on social media is connected to an account's 
            credibility, political leaning, and network structure. This poster was accepted to the  Seventh National Workshop for REU Research in Networking and Systems (REUNS 2021), and it is also listed on the <a href="https://reu.isi.edu/2021.html">REU website</a>.</div>
